## FAQ: Navigating Your SOC Journey

### **Q: Should I do all 10 projects before applying for jobs?**
**A:** No. After Projects 1-3 + 7 (12 weeks), you're ready for entry-level SOC roles. Don't wait for "perfect" skills.

### **Q: I don't have time for 20+ weeks of projects. What's the minimum?**
**A:** Projects 1, 2, 3 (foundation) - 8 weeks. This gets you job-ready for Tier-1 SOC.

### **Q: How important is Project 7 (SOAR automation)?**
**A:** **Very important** for 2026+ roles. It differentiates you from 95% of candidates. Prioritize it if targeting modern SOCs.

### **Q: Can I skip the manual projects (1-6) and just do automation (7-10)?**
**A:** No. Automation without understanding fundamentals is dangerous. Do 1-3 minimum before 7.

### **Q: Which certifications should I get first?**
**A:** Security+ (validates foundation) → AWS/Azure cloud cert → AI-focused (SEC545, AI-102) if pursuing 2026 path.

### **Q: How do I balance learning vs. job applications?**
**A:** 80/20 rule: 80% learning (projects) until Week 10, then 20% learning + 80% applications. Don't over-optimize.

### **Q: What if I get stuck on a project?**
**A:** Use platform communities (LetsDefend Discord, TryHackMe forums), Google specific errors, revisit template instructions. Don't stay stuck >24 hours - ask for help.

### **Q: How long until I'm "job-ready"?**
**A:** 
- Tier-1 SOC: 8-10 weeks (Projects 1-3)
- Tier-2 SOC: 16-20 weeks (Projects 1-6 + 7)
- Specialized (Detection/AI): 24+ weeks (All projects + certs)

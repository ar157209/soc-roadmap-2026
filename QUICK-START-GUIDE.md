## 💼 Resume Preparation

### As You Complete Each Project:

1. **Copy 2-3 resume bullets** from the template
2. **Customize with YOUR metrics:**
   - Bad: "Monitored security alerts"
   - Good: "Monitored and triaged 150+ security alerts..."
   
3. **Save** in a `resume-bullets.md` file
4. **After 3 projects:** Update your actual resume and LinkedIn

**Pro Tip:** Don't wait until you finish all 6 projects to start applying. After completing Projects 1-3, you're ready for entry-level SOC roles!

## 🚨 Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ **Trying to do everything at once** → Focus on ONE project at a time
2. ❌ **Skipping documentation** → Future you will regret not taking notes
3. ❌ **Not redacting screenshots** → NEVER share real company data
4. ❌ **Perfectionism** → Done is better than perfect; iterate as you learn
5. ❌ **Waiting to feel "ready"** → Start now, learn as you go

## 🤝 Getting Help

### When You're Stuck:

1. **Re-read the relevant template section** (seriously, 80% of answers are there)
2. **Platform communities:**
   - LetsDefend Discord
   - TryHackMe forums
   - CyberDefenders Discord
3. **Google the specific error/concept** (e.g., "What is SPF in email headers?")
4. **LinkedIn SOC analyst groups** - connect with others doing similar projects

---

## ✅ Minimum Viable Portfolio (MVP)
